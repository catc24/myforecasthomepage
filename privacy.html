  <h1>SnowDay Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: January 31, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    SnowDay is a weather app that shows forecasts and a snow day probability.
    We collect only what we need to provide these features and do not sell your data.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> If you grant permission, we use your device location to show local weather and forecasts.</li>
    <li><strong>Device token (push notifications):</strong> If you enable notifications, we store your device token to send alerts you choose to receive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To request weather data for your area from third-party providers.</li>
    <li>To send snow day probability updates and alerts you opt in to receive.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app may use third-party services to provide weather data and alerts (for example, Weather.gov and Apple WeatherKit).
    These services may process your location to return weather data.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We keep device tokens only as long as needed to deliver notifications. You can disable notifications at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can allow or deny location access in your device settings.</li>
    <li>You can enable or disable notifications in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable measures to protect the information we process.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    SnowDay is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available in the app or on our website.
